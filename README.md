## User-Centric Design
To model our data structure effectively, we've created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). This visual representation maps out the relationships between various entities in our system, such as users, child profiles, vaccines, and medications. The ERD serves as a blueprint for our database design, ensuring that data is organized and structured efficiently.

## Features

### Track Vaccines for Your Child

Our application serves as a comprehensive guide to your child's immunization journey. Keep all your child's vaccine information in one place and have it at your fingertips, anytime, anywhere.

### Know Administered Vaccines

Say goodbye to sifting through papers and health records. Our app keeps a log of all vaccines your child has received. It gives you detailed information, including the type of vaccine and the date it was administered. This way, you are always aware of your child's immunization status and can easily provide records to healthcare providers or educational institutions.

### Overdue Alerts

Never miss a vaccine again! Our app sends you timely notifications for any vaccines that are overdue, ensuring your child's immunization schedule stays on track. In the overdue section, you can quickly check which vaccines you have missed along with the recommended time frame for each.

### Upcoming Vaccines

Planning is key to ensuring your child gets all the required vaccines on time. Our application provides you with a list of upcoming vaccines, complete with due dates and information about each vaccine. With these reminders, you can easily schedule appointments with healthcare providers well in advance.

### Peace of Mind

The uncertainty and complexity of managing your child's vaccination schedule can be stressful. Our app alleviates that stress and ensures you are well-informed, helping you make better healthcare decisions for your child.

### User-Friendly Dashboard

All of these features come wrapped in an intuitive, user-friendly interface. With simple navigation and easy-to-read displays, tracking your child's vaccines has never been this effortless.

## Project Approach

### The Challenge of New Parenthood

Becoming a parent is a monumental milestone filled with joy, love, and, naturally, challenges. One such challenge that new parents often face is navigating through the complex and sometimes overwhelming world of childhood vaccinations. As a parent of a newborn, I found myself jumping through hoops, scouring numerous resources, and dealing with a maze of healthcare guidelines to get accurate and timely information about vaccinations. While these initial years should be spent enjoying the miraculous journey of your child's growth, parents often find themselves bogged down by the intricacies of vaccine schedules, dosages, and medical jargon.

### The Inspiration

That's when it hit meâ€”why not build something for future parents that would make those first years easier to enjoy? I wanted to create a tool that alleviates this stress, so parents can focus on what really matters: raising a happy, healthy child.

### The Solution: A One-Stop App for Child Immunization

And so, this app was bornâ€”crafted with the utmost care and diligence to serve as a one-stop solution for all your childâ€™s vaccination needs. With features that allow you to track administered vaccines, set overdue alerts, and even get a heads-up on upcoming vaccinations, the app aims to empower parents to take control of their child's health in a simplified and user-friendly way.

### Empowering Parents

Through this app, I hope to bring peace of mind to you as a parent, because when you're informed and prepared, you can make better healthcare decisions for your child. With all the information and reminders at your fingertips, you can reclaim those joyful moments that might otherwise be lost to worry and uncertainty.

### The Reward

The true reward for this project lies in the knowledge that it may help parents breathe a little easier and enjoy the priceless first years of their childâ€™s life a bit more fully. After all, informed parenting is empowered parenting, and thatâ€™s a gift that keeps on giving.

### JWT Token Generation and Validation

- **Challenge**: Implementing JWT token generation and validation in Spring Security can be intricate. Ensuring that tokens are securely generated, stored, and validated is crucial for application security.

### Cucumber-JVM Testing

- **Challenge**: Using Cucumber-JVM for behavior-driven development (BDD) testing can be challenging, especially  new to this framework. Writing and maintaining feature files, step definitions, and ensuring effective test coverage can be hurdles.

### Integration Testing

- **Challenge**: Testing the integration of various components, including the Spring Boot application, Spring Security, and JWT token handling, can be complex. Properly setting up and running integration tests can be challenging.

### Documentation and Code Maintenance

- **Challenge**: Maintaining comprehensive documentation and keeping the codebase clean and well-documented can be challenging but is essential for long-term maintainability.

### Testing Edge Cases

- **Challenge**: Identifying and testing edge cases in your application, especially related to Spring Security and JWT token handling, can be challenging but is crucial for robustness.

### Error Handling

- **Challenge**: Properly handling and logging errors and exceptions in a consistent and meaningful way can be a hurdle. Ensuring that error messages do not expose sensitive information is important for security.
